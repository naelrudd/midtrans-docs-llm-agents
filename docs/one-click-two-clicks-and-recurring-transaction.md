# One Click, Two Clicks, and Recurring Transaction

Card payment is easy and secure.\
However for customer of certain business model can be quite tedious having to re-input their Credit Card each time they want to make transaction (especially those with high frequency of transaction). Midtrans can improve payment experience by using following features:

# ONE CLICK

One Click allows merchant to securely save customer’s credit card details (including CVV) in a form of one-click-token in the initial transaction. Once the customer wants to do the next payment, merchant can easily retrieve the previously-saved credit card details using the token. Since card details are already stored, customer needs to do one simple step:

Trigger the payment (e.g click “**Pay Now**”)

# TWO CLICKS

Two Clicks allows you to securely save customer’s credit card details (excluding CVV) in a form of two-click-token for the initial transaction. Once the customer wants to do the next payment, merchant can easily retrieve the previously-saved credit card details using the token. Since card details are already stored, customer needs to do two simple steps:

1. Enter their CVV,
2. Trigger the payment.

# RECURRING (SUBSCRIPTION)

Recurring allows you to securely save customer’s credit card details (including CVV) in a form of recurring-token. After initial payment, you can charge payment whenever your business want to charge the customer, such as for periodical subscription payment. The payment is triggered on merchant’s side, without any customer interaction.

Under the hood, recurring and one click is exactly same feature. The difference is what trigger the charge (logic in your server or customer action).

# HOW CAN IT HELPS YOUR BUSINESS GROW

These are some real life example on how your business can utilize this feature to improve customer experience, and more importantly increase conversion rate on your business (which means better revenue for your business).

# Improve The Experience of Following Payment:

For ecommerce such as online shop, you should make sure payment experience for your customer is frictionless, use one click feature to save customer’s credit card payment details on the first time they do payment. Next time they want to make another payment, all they need to do is choose their saved card then click pay, without re-entering their card details anymore.

Two clicks is similar, but CVV need to be inputted for each transaction, this allow you to have additional layer of security for your customer before confirming payment. Choose one suit your needs.

Recurring payment feature come in handy, with this feature you can save card detail on customer’s first payment. Then you can conveniently charge your customer using their saved credit card details, scheduled automatically from your server whenever you want it to be charged (e.g weekly, monthly, annually, etc.).
